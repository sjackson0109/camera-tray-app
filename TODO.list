1. Usability Enhancements
Include hotkey support for show camera! Ctrl + Shift + I ?
Provide a graphical interface for adding and editing cameras directly from the application, rather than requiring manual edits to the camera.config file.
Include tooltips in the system tray menu to improve user experience.
Allow users to save common configurations as templates for rapid deployment.
2. Configuration Management
Validate the camera.config file at runtime to identify errors and suggest corrections, ensuring no interruptions due to invalid JSON.
Support importing and exporting configuration files for easier sharing and backup.
3. Error Handling and Logging
Make debug logging adjustable from the UI instead of requiring JSON edits.
Include timestamps and session identifiers in logs for easier troubleshooting.
Provide detailed error messages for stream failures, specifying whether it's a network issue, authentication failure, or an invalid URL.
4. Security Improvements
Encrypt sensitive information like User and Password in the camera.config file. Try system.security.cryptography class
Implement HTTPS for secure communication with camera URLs if the cameras support it.
5. Performance Optimization
Add a benchmarking tool within the app to test and rate the performance of configured camera streams.
Allow dynamic resizing of video windows based on available system resources.
6. Expanded Features
Separate UDP or TCP feeds, with a tickbox.
Integrate support for other video stream protocols (e.g., HLS, MPEG-DASH).
Add an option to record streams or capture snapshots directly from the app.
Offer scheduling options for camera activation, e.g., only stream during specified times.
7. Documentation and Onboarding
Include a wizard or guided setup during the first launch to assist users in configuring their cameras.
Expand the README with troubleshooting steps for common ffplay issues.
Provide examples for advanced configurations, such as grouped layouts or multi-screen setups.
8. ONVIF discovery tool - popout separate to the config window.
